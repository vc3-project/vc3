'''
  Module to handle plugins dispatch, config.
  Model is plugins are kept in hierarchy by 'category', beneath category are types:
  
  <package>/plugina/<category>/<type>/<PluginName>.py
                              
Plugins initialized with ConfigParser object and a section name as arguments. The 
assumption is that the classes themselves know how to look up the info they need. 
It is also assumed that Singleton/non-Singleton decision is made during class initialization.

    This handler does nothing. It's intended to be used to avoid the

    important for library code, which may contain code to log events. If a user
    of the library does not configure logging, the one-off warning might be
    produced; to avoid this, the library developer simply needs to instantiate
    a NullHandler and add it to the top-level logger of the library module or
